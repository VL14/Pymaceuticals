The purpose of this study is to screen potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma, a common form of skin cancer. Over 45 days, 250 mice were treated with different drugs. This analysis evaluated 10 drug regimens on male and female mice with the purpose of measuring the size of tumors during the course of treatment.

Charts include a bar plot showing the number of data points for each drug, a pie plot showing the distribution between male and female mice, box plots of the final tumor volume for the top 4 performing drug regimens, and a line plot of the timepoint vs tumor volume for a single mouse on the top performing drug.

Additional analysis includes summary statistics by drug, and the correlation coefficient for mouse weight and tumor volume.
